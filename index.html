<!-- Hey love, I made this as a starter website for you. This is only half of the gift really. The other half is me teaching you how to change it however you want! Time is a bit tight now because of the deadlines we have, and I dont 
always have the energy, but I want to make sure you know how to do it yourself :) I love you -Rhett Applestone 9-26-22-->

        <p>Hi, my name is Felix! My favorite food is pasta carbonara, favorite fruit is mango, favorite candy is splot sour gum, and favorite number is 11. I like 
          washi tape and making little cute presents for my boyfriend. Cavetown is one of my favorite artists, I wear Axe Apollo 48 hr anti sweat deodorant,
          and I like doing phography sometimes (<a href="PHOTO-2021-01-05-09-36-16.jpg">Here</a> is a photo I took) and other crafty things. I also made an airboat
